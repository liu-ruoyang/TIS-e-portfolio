## Tasks and Reflections

### Task 1: System Overview and Database Planning
- **Description**: Analyzed the current challenges in hospital management systems and outlined the mission, objectives, and boundaries for the proposed HMS.
- **Reflection**:
  - Learned to identify key pain points in existing systems and propose targeted solutions.
  - Realized the importance of setting clear boundaries and scopes to avoid overcomplication.
  - Gained experience in defining mission statements and objectives aligned with user needs and industry standards.

---

### Task 2: Conceptual Design
- **Description**: Developed an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to model the hospital's data structure, including patients, doctors, appointments, and billing.
- **Reflection**:
  - Improved understanding of database normalization and relationship cardinalities.
  - Learned to translate real-world scenarios into structured database models.
  - Collaborated effectively with team members to ensure consistency and accuracy in the design.

---

### Task 3: Logical Design and Normalization
- **Description**: Converted the conceptual ERD into logical schemas, ensuring all tables met BCNF standards and aligning with system requirements.
- **Reflection**:
  - Strengthened skills in normalization by addressing redundancy and ensuring data integrity.
  - Understood the trade-offs between simplicity and scalability in schema design.
  - Enhanced technical expertise in creating clean and efficient database structures.

---

### Task 4: Implementation and Query Development
- **Description**: Created the database schema using SQL and developed queries for basic operations, joins, and statistical analysis.
- **Reflection**:
  - Gained practical experience in SQL coding, including table creation and data manipulation.
  - Learned to write optimized queries for complex scenarios like aggregations and joins.
  - Realized the importance of query validation to ensure accuracy and performance.

---

### Task 5: Report and User Manual
- **Description**: Consolidated all tasks into a comprehensive report and created a user manual to guide system usage.
- **Reflection**:
  - Improved documentation skills by summarizing technical details in a user-friendly manner.
  - Understood the importance of clear communication in delivering technical projects.
  - Developed insights into how to structure a user manual for diverse audiences, including technical and non-technical users.

---

## Overall Reflection
This project provided a holistic learning experience in database design and implementation, from initial planning to final documentation. Key takeaways include:
- The significance of user-centric design in creating practical and efficient systems.
- The importance of team collaboration and clear communication in managing complex tasks.
- Enhanced problem-solving and technical skills, especially in normalization and SQL query optimization.
